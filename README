##ABOUT##
The code was written in arduino IDE v0020 for Atmega8 @ 8Mhz
Default arduino IDE does not have the board description for using an atmega8 @ 8MHZ refer http://todbot.com/blog/2009/05/26/minimal-arduino-with-atmega8/ on hgow to set up your IDE to work properly if you want to use an atmega 8(Or just use a regular arduino board).

The code is currently in super-pre-alpha stage and is not fit for use by anyone who does not know his/her stuff.


##HARDWARE DESCRIPTION##
(again super-pre-alpha stage)
The hardware for this cnc consists of an atmega8 and 3 L293D dual H-bridge chips. The chips are connected to 1 bipolar stepper motor each to control the X, Y, Z axes. The UART of the atmega is connected to a MAX232A TTL to RS232 (serial) chip to facillitate control and monitoring on the PC.

Pin assignments

X-axis Stepper pins 2,4,3,5
Y-axis Stepper pins 6,8,7,9
Z-axis Stepper pins 10,12,11,13

The order of the above pins matter because that is the order in which the coils have to be excited.

There are currently no limit switches however this has been taken care of in the new software update being developed.
